# The Neural Code of Action Sequences: From Learning to Execution
**COSYNE 2026 Workshop · March 16, 2026**

## About
Intelligent behavior in the animal kingdom relies on the ability to swiftly and smoothly link multiple actions to achieve behavioral goals. For example, a zebra finch learns to perform a complex set of vocalizations to attract a mate, much like a skilled musician improvises over a cascade of notes.
Animals flexibly plan and execute sequences of actions, adapting them to immediate needs and changing environments. Studies investigating the neural basis of sequence production span a wide range of model organisms, brain regions, and task settings. We propose that, despite this diversity, the brain is addressing a shared computational challenge: orchestrating a sequence of actions.
A central theme of our workshop is to define and describe the concept of 'sequencing.' Does it involve selecting the appropriate actions and arranging them in the correct order? Does it refer to the neural mechanisms that facilitate smooth transitions between these actions? Or does it encompass the generation of individual motor commands for each action?
